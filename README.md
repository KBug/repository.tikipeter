INFO:
Fen's next update will have many feature and setting removals. It might be wise to make sure you know how to roll back an update if you aren't happy with the changes.

This next feautre purge is more a "settings" purge really. Some features are being removed, but the main focus for me was streamlining the settings as much as possible whilst still keeping Fen open to many user-defined preferences. Well over 40 settings have been removed.

An non-exclusive list of features being removed...
* Pre-emptive Termination of scrapers.
* Backup/Restore of settings.
* Auto Removal of failing scrapers. Includes removal of keeping stats on scraper success/failure.
* Filtering results by size (this is being replaced, not removed entirely. You now enter your internet line speed and Fen auto establishes the maximum size of files to display/play based on the duration of the media. You can no longer set minimum sizes, though).

Settings being removed mainly revolve around those feature removals, as well as some personalization type settings to do with color choices/display preferences etc.

As I said, learn how to install a previous version before this next update which is due in ~24 hours so if a setting/feature is removed that you wanted kept badly, you can install the previous version. This is not really recommended though, as you are then stuck at that version forever. It would probably be best to move to a different addon if Fen no longer supports the settings/features you require.
